\section{Task Definition}
\label{intro}

The task accomplished by this project is to build an AI agent which would land with constant high rewards on a landing pad, defined by Box2D Lunar Lander available on OpenAI gym. This is accomplished by Reinforcement Learning, particularly by applying different Q-learning techniques. This project has explored Full DQN, Double DQN and Dueling Network Architecture (Dueling DQN), their performances in "solving" the game. We have considered a game to be solved when the agent starts getting average reward of 200 over 100 consecutive episodes. Moreover, performances have also been compared with baselines and oracle.
